# gh-userscript-form-feed-line

A userscript to properly display [form-feed characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break) (ASCII `0xC`, Unicode `\f`) in GitHub code source blocks.

Those characters, originally intended to delimit page breaks, are commonly found in Lisp (Elisp, Clojure...), C and Python source code as a commentary to delimit sections of code.
